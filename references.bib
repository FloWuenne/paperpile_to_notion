  abstract    = "Fibrosis represents the common end stage of chronic organ
                 injury independent of the initial insult, destroying tissue
                 architecture and driving organ failure. Here we discover a
                 population of profibrotic macrophages marked by expression of
                 Spp1, Fn1, and Arg1 (termed Spp1 macrophages), which expands
                 after organ injury. Using an unbiased approach, we identify
                 the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 4 (CXCL4) to be among the
                 top upregulated genes during profibrotic Spp1 macrophage
                 differentiation. In vitro and in vivo studies show that loss
                 of Cxcl4 abrogates profibrotic Spp1 macrophage differentiation
                 and ameliorates fibrosis after both heart and kidney injury.
                 Moreover, we find that platelets, the most abundant source of
                 CXCL4 in vivo, drive profibrotic Spp1 macrophage
                 differentiation. Single nuclear RNA sequencing with
                 ligand-receptor interaction analysis reveals that macrophages
                 orchestrate fibroblast activation via Spp1, Fn1, and Sema3
                 crosstalk. Finally, we confirm that Spp1 macrophages expand in
                 both human chronic kidney disease and heart failure.",

  abstract = "Cell type deconvolution is a computational method for the
              determination/resolution of cell type proportions from bulk
              sequencing data, frequently used for the analysis of divergent
              cell types in tumor tissue samples. However, deconvolution
              technology is still in its infancy for the analysis of cell types
              using proteomic data due to challenges with
              repeatability/reproducibility, variable reference standards and
              the lack of single-cell proteomic reference data. Here, we
              developed a novel deep learning-based deconvolution method
              (scpDeconv) tailored to proteomic data. scpDeconv uses an
              autoencoder to leverage the information from bulk proteomic data
              to improve the quality of single-cell proteomic data, and employs
              a domain adversarial architecture to bridge the single-cell and
              bulk data distributions and transfer labels from single-cell data
              to bulk data. Extensive experiments validated the performance of
              scpDeconv in the deconvolution of proteomic data produced from
              various species/sources and different proteomic technologies.
              This method should find broad applicability to areas including
              tumor microenvironment interpretation and clinical
              diagnosis/classification. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The

  abstract    = "Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has become a powerful
                 technology to quantify the entire complement of proteins in
                 cells or tissues. Here, we review challenges and recent
                 advances in the LC-MS-based analysis of minute protein
                 amounts, down to the level of single cells. Application of
                 this technology revealed that single-cell transcriptomes are
                 dominated by stochastic noise due to the very low number of
                 transcripts per cell, whereas the single-cell proteome appears
                 to be complete. The spatial organization of cells in tissues
                 can be studied by emerging technologies, including multiplexed
                 imaging and spatial transcriptomics, which can now be combined
                 with ultra-sensitive proteomics. Combined with high-content
                 imaging, artificial intelligence and single-cell laser
                 microdissection, MS-based proteomics provides an unbiased
                 molecular readout close to the functional level. Potential
