              complex traits in specific genomic regions, which could shed
              unique light on etiologic sharing and provide additional
              mechanistic insights into the genetic basis of complex traits
              compared to global genetic correlation. However, accurate
              estimation of local genetic correlation remains challenging, in
              part due to extensive linkage disequilibrium in local genomic
              regions and pervasive sample overlap across studies. We introduce
              SUPERGNOVA, a unified framework to estimate both global and local
              genetic correlations using summary statistics from genome-wide
              association studies. Through extensive simulations and analyses
              of 30 complex traits, we demonstrate that SUPERGNOVA
              substantially outperforms existing methods and identifies 150
              trait pairs with significant local genetic correlations. In
              particular, we show that the positive, consistently-identified,
              yet paradoxical genetic correlation between autism spectrum
              disorder and cognitive performance could be explained by two
              etiologically-distinct genetic signatures with bidirectional
              local genetic correlations. We believe that
              statistically-rigorous local genetic correlation analysis could
              accelerate progress in complex trait genetics research. \#\#\#

               analyses, especially RNA sequencing and other genomics

               biomarkers and molecular regulators associated with tumor
               growth, metastasis and drug resistance. However, these
               approaches fail to provide a complete picture of tumor biology,
               as information on cellular location within the tumor
               microenvironment is lost. New technologies leveraging
               multiplexed fluorescence, DNA, RNA and isotope labeling enable
               the detection of tens to thousands of cancer subclones or

               diseases, the vast majority of causal variants underlying
               disease-associated loci have not been identified[1][1]--[3][2].
               To create an atlas of causal variants, we performed and
               integrated fine-mapping across 148 complex traits in three
               large-scale biobanks (BioBank Japan[4][3],[5][4], FinnGen[6][5],
               and UK Biobank[7][6],[8][7]; total n = 811,261), resulting in
               4,518 variant-trait pairs with high posterior probability (>
               0.9) of causality. Of these, we found 285 high-confidence
               variant-trait pairs replicated across multiple populations, and
               we characterized multiple contributors to the surprising lack of
               overlap among fine-mapping results from different biobanks. By
               studying the bottlenecked Finnish and Japanese populations, we
               identified 21 and 26 putative causal coding variants with
               extreme allele frequency enrichment (> 10-fold) in these two
               populations, respectively. Aggregating data across populations
               enabled identification of 1,492 unique fine-mapped coding
               variants and 176 genes in which multiple independent coding
               variants influence the same trait ( i.e. , with an allelic
               series of coding variants). Our results demonstrate that
               fine-mapping in diverse populations enables novel insights into
               the biology of complex traits by pinpointing high-confidence
               causal variants for further characterization. \#\#\# Competing

  abstract  = "Accurate cell-type annotation from spatially resolved single
               cells is crucial to understand functional spatial biology that
               is the basis of tissue organization. However, current
               computational methods for annotating spatially resolved
               single-cell data are typically based on techniques established
               for dissociated single-cell technologies and thus do not take
               spatial organization into account. Here we present STELLAR, a
               geometric deep learning method for cell-type discovery and
               identification in spatially resolved single-cell datasets.
               STELLAR automatically assigns cells to cell types present in the
               annotated reference dataset and discovers novel cell types and
               cell states. STELLAR transfers annotations across different
               dissection regions, different tissues and different donors, and
               learns cell representations that capture higher-order tissue
               structures. We successfully applied STELLAR to CODEX multiplexed

                 originate from a reservoir in the spleen, and the release from
                 their splenic niche relies on angiotensin (Ang) II signaling.
                 OBJECTIVE: Because monocytes are centrally involved in tissue
                 repair after ischemia, we hypothesized that early
                 angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy impacts
                 healing after myocardial infarction partly via effects on
                 monocyte traffic. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a mouse model of
                 permanent coronary ligation, enalapril arrested the release of
                 monocytes from the splenic reservoir and consequently reduced
                 their recruitment into the healing infarct by 45\%, as
                 quantified by flow cytometry of digested infarcts. Time-lapse
                 intravital microscopy revealed that enalapril reduces monocyte
                 motility in the spleen. In vitro migration assays and Western
                 blotting showed that this was caused by reduced signaling
                 through the Ang II type 1 receptor. We then studied the
                 long-term consequences of blocked splenic monocyte release in
                 atherosclerotic apolipoprotein (apo)E(-/-) mice, in which
                 infarct healing is impaired because of excessive inflammation
                 in the cardiac wound. Enalapril improved histologic healing
                 biomarkers and reduced inflammation in infarcts measured by
                 FMT-CT (fluorescence molecular tomography in conjunction with
                 x-ray computed tomography) of proteolytic activity. ACE
                 inhibition improved MRI-derived ejection fraction by 14\% on
                 day 21, despite initially comparable infarct size. In
                 apoE(-/-) mice, ischemia/reperfusion injury resulted in larger
                 infarct size and enhanced monocyte recruitment and was
                 reversible by enalapril treatment. Splenectomy reproduced
                 antiinflammatory effects of enalapril. CONCLUSION: This study
                 suggests that benefits of early ACE inhibition after
                 myocardial infarction can partially be attributed to its
                 potent antiinflammatory impact on the splenic monocyte
                 reservoir.",

  abstract    = "RATIONALE: Recent advancements have brought to light the
                 origins, complexity, and functions of tissue-resident
                 macrophages. However, in the context of tissue injury or
                 disease, large numbers of monocytes infiltrate the heart and
                 are thought to contribute to adverse remodeling and heart
                 failure pathogenesis. Little is understood about the diversity
                 of monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages recruited to the
                 heart after myocardial injury, including the mechanisms that
                 regulate monocyte recruitment and fate specification.
                 OBJECTIVE: We sought to test the hypothesis that distinct
                 subsets of tissue-resident CCR2- (C-C chemokine receptor 2)
                 and CCR2+ macrophages orchestrate monocyte recruitment and
                 fate specification after myocardial injury. METHODS AND
                 RESULTS: We reveal that in numerous mouse models of
                 cardiomyocyte cell death (permanent myocardial infarction,
                 reperfused myocardial infarction, and diphtheria toxin
                 cardiomyocyte ablation), there is a shift in macrophage
                 ontogeny whereby tissue-resident macrophages are predominately
                 replaced by infiltrating monocytes and monocyte-derived
                 macrophages. Using syngeneic cardiac transplantation to model
                 ischemia-reperfusion injury and distinguish tissue-resident
                 from recruited cell populations in combination with intravital
                 2-photon microscopy, we demonstrate that monocyte recruitment
                 is differentially orchestrated by distinct subsets of
                 tissue-resident cardiac macrophages. Tissue-resident CCR2+
                 macrophages promote monocyte recruitment through an MYD88
                 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88)-dependent
                 mechanism that results in release of MCPs (monocyte
                 chemoattractant proteins) and monocyte mobilization. In
                 contrast, tissue-resident CCR2- macrophages inhibit monocyte
                 recruitment. Using CD (cluster of differentiation) 169-DTR
                 (diphtheria toxin receptor) and CCR2-DTR mice, we further show
                 that selective depletion of either tissue-resident CCR2- or
                 CCR2+ macrophages before myocardial infarction results in
                 divergent effects on left ventricular function, myocardial
                 remodeling, and monocyte recruitment. Finally, using
                 single-cell RNA sequencing, we show that tissue-resident
                 cardiac macrophages differentially instruct monocyte fate
                 specification. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these observations
                 establish the mechanistic basis by which monocytes are
                 initially recruited to the injured heart and provide new
                 insights into the heterogeneity of monocyte-derived

                 with most existing methods involving substantial manual

                 single-cell transcriptomes at steady state and after

              populations that drive fibrosis in the human heart and the
              mechanisms that govern their emergence remain incompletely
              defined. Here, we performed Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes
              and Epitomes by sequencing (CITE-seq) in 22 explanted human
              hearts from healthy donors, acute myocardial infarction (MI), and
              chronic ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy patients. We
              identified a fibroblast trajectory marked by fibroblast activator
              protein (FAP) and periostin (POSTN) expression that was
              independent of myofibroblasts, peaked early after MI, remained
              elevated in chronic heart failure, and displayed a
              transcriptional signature consistent with fibrotic activity. We
              assessed the applicability of cardiac fibrosis models and
              demonstrated that mouse MI, angiotensin II/phenylephrine
              infusion, and pressure overload models were superior compared to
              cultured human heart and dermal fibroblasts in recapitulating
              cardiac fibroblast diversity including pathogenic cell states.
              Ligand-receptor analysis and spatial transcriptomics predicted
              interactions between macrophages, T cells, and fibroblasts within
              spatially defined niches. CCR2+ monocyte and macrophage states
              were the dominant source of ligands targeting fibroblasts.
              Inhibition of IL-1$\beta$ signaling to cardiac fibroblasts was
              sufficient to suppress fibrosis, emergence, and maturation of

                 hoc, and we continue to lack a principled, unified, and
                 well-moored system for defining, naming, and organizing cell

                 periodic table-like discretization as the right metaphor for a
                 reference taxonomy of cell types. In its place, we advocate
                 for a data-driven, tree-based nomenclature that is rooted in a
                 ``consensus ontogeny'' spanning the life cycle of a given
                 species. We explore how such a reference cell tree, inclusive
                 of both lineage histories and molecular states, could be
                 constructed, represented, and segmented in practice. Analogous
                 to the taxonomic classification of species, a consensus
                 ontogeny would provide a universal, stable, and extendable

  abstract = "Although several studies have applied single-cell approaches to
              explore gene expression changes in aged brains, they were limited
              by the relatively shallow sampling of brain cell populations, and
              thus may have failed to capture aspects of the molecular
              signatures and dynamics of rare cell types associated with aging
              and diseases. Here, we set out to investigate the age-dependent
              dynamics of transcription and chromatin accessibility across
              diverse brain cell types. With EasySci , an extensively improved
              single-cell combinatorial indexing strategy, we profiled ∼1.5
              million single-cell transcriptomes and ∼400,000 single-cell
              chromatin accessibility profiles across mouse brains spanning
              different ages, genotypes, and both sexes. With a novel
              computational framework designed for characterizing cellular
              subtypes based on the expression of both genes and exons, we
              identified > 300 cell subtypes and deciphered the underlying
              molecular programs and spatial locations of rare cell types (
              e.g., pinealocytes, tanycytes) and subtypes. Leveraging these
              data, we generate a global readout of age-dependent cell
              population dynamics with high cellular subtype resolution,
              providing insights into cell types that expand (e.g., rare
              astrocytes and vascular leptomeningeal cells in the olfactory
              bulb, reactive microglia and oligodendrocytes) or are depleted (
              e.g., neuronal progenitors, neuroblasts, committed
              oligodendrocyte precursors) as age progresses. Furthermore, we
              explored cell-type-specific responses to genetic perturbations
              associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and identify rare cell
              types depleted ( e.g., mt-Cytb + , mt-Rnr2 + choroid plexus
              epithelial cells) or enriched ( e.g., Col25a1 +, Ndrg1 +
              interbrain and midbrain neurons) in both AD models. Key findings
              are consistent between males and females, validated across the
              transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, and spatial analyses.
              Finally, we profiled a total of 118,240 single-nuclei
              transcriptomes from twenty-four human brain samples derived from
              control and AD patients, revealing highly cell-type-specific and
              region-specific gene expression changes associated with AD
              pathogenesis. Critical AD-associated gene signatures were
              validated in both human and mice. In summary, these data comprise
              a rich resource for exploring cell-type-specific dynamics and the
              underlying molecular mechanisms in both normal and pathological

  abstract  = "The border zone (BZ) of the infarcted heart is a geographically
               complex and biologically enigmatic interface separating poorly
               perfused infarct zones (IZs) from remote zones (RZs). The
               cellular and molecular mechanisms of myocardial BZs are not well
               understood because microdissection inevitably combines them with
               uncontrolled amounts of RZs and IZs. Here, we use
               single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and
               multiplexed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization to redefine
               the BZ based on cardiomyocyte transcriptomes. BZ1 (Nppa+Xirp2−)
               forms a hundreds-of-micrometer-thick layer of morphologically
               intact cells adjacent to RZs that are detectable within an hour
               of injury. Meanwhile, BZ2 (Nppa+Xirp2+) forms a
               near-single-cell-thick layer of morphologically distorted
               cardiomyocytes at the IZ edge that colocalize with matricellular
               protein-expressing myofibroblasts and express predominantly
               mechanotransduction genes. Surprisingly, mechanical injury alone
               is sufficient to induce BZ genes. We propose a `loss of
               neighbor' hypothesis to explain how ischemic cell death
               mechanically destabilizes the BZ to induce its transcriptional
               response. Using single-cell/single-nucleus RNA sequencing and
               spatial transcriptomic analysis, Calcagno and Taghdiri et al.
               define the ischemic border zone---the area between the poorly
               perfused infarct area and the remote zones of the heart---based
               on the cardiomyocyte transcriptomes. The transcriptional border
               zone emerges within an hour of the ischemic injury and can be
               observed in response to any injury that causes loss of
               neighboring cells and mechanical destabilization, including the
               trauma induced with a fine needle.",

                 offers an integrated cell atlas with harmonized metadata that
                 users can integrate new data with. Here, we present DISCO
                 (https://www.immunesinglecell.org/), a database of Deeply
                 Integrated Single-Cell Omics data. The current release of
                 DISCO integrates more than 18 million cells from 4593 samples,
                 covering 107 tissues/cell lines/organoids, 158 diseases, and
                 20 platforms. We standardized the associated metadata with a
                 controlled vocabulary and ontology system. To allow large
                 scale integration of single-cell data, we developed
                 FastIntegration, a fast and high-capacity version of Seurat
                 Integration. We also developed CELLiD, an atlas guided
                 automatic cell type identification tool. Employing these two
                 tools on the assembled data, we constructed one global atlas
                 and 27 sub-atlases for different tissues, diseases, and cell
                 types. DISCO provides three online tools, namely Online
                 FastIntegration, Online CELLiD, and CellMapper, for users to
                 integrate, annotate, and project uploaded single-cell RNA-seq

              characterization of human disease. In these complex experimental
              designs, patient samples are profiled across distinct cell-types
              and clinical conditions to describe disease processes at the
              cellular level. However, most of the current analysis tools are
              limited to pairwise cross-condition comparisons, disregarding the
              multicellular nature of disease processes and the effects of
              other biological and technical factors in the variation of gene
              expression. Here we propose a computational framework for an
              unsupervised analysis of samples from cross-condition single-cell
              atlases and for the identification of multicellular programs
              associated with disease. Our strategy, that repurposes
              multi-omics factor analysis, incorporates the variation of
              patient samples across cell-types and enables the joint analysis
              of multiple patient cohorts, facilitating integration of atlases.
              We applied our analysis to a collection of acute and chronic
              human heart failure single-cell datasets and described
              multicellular processes of cardiac remodeling that were conserved
              in independent spatial and bulk transcriptomics datasets. In sum,
              our framework serves as an exploratory tool for unsupervised
              analysis of cross-condition single-cell atlas and allows for the
              integration of the measurements of patient cohorts across
              distinct data modalities, facilitating the generation of
              comprehensive tissue-centric understanding of disease.

                 we present DISCO-MS, a technology that combines
                 whole-organ/whole-organism clearing and imaging,
                 deep-learning-based image analysis, robotic tissue extraction,
                 and ultra-high-sensitivity mass spectrometry. DISCO-MS yielded
                 proteome data indistinguishable from uncleared samples in both
                 rodent and human tissues. We used DISCO-MS to investigate
                 microglia activation along axonal tracts after brain injury
                 and characterized early- and late-stage individual
                 amyloid-beta plaques in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
                 DISCO-bot robotic sample extraction enabled us to study the
                 regional heterogeneity of immune cells in intact mouse bodies
                 and aortic plaques in a complete human heart. DISCO-MS enables
                 unbiased proteome analysis of preclinical and clinical tissues
