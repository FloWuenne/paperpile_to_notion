  abstract  = "The advancement of highly multiplexed spatial technologies
               requires scalable methods that can leverage spatial information.
               We present MISTy, a flexible, scalable, and explainable machine
               learning framework for extracting relationships from any spatial
               omics data, from dozens to thousands of measured markers. MISTy
               builds multiple views focusing on different spatial or
               functional contexts to dissect different effects. We evaluated
               MISTy on in silico and breast cancer datasets measured by
               imaging mass cytometry and spatial transcriptomics. We estimated
               structural and functional interactions coming from different
               spatial contexts in breast cancer and demonstrated how to relate
               MISTy's results to clinical features.",
