  abstract    = "Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has become a powerful
                 technology to quantify the entire complement of proteins in
                 cells or tissues. Here, we review challenges and recent
                 advances in the LC-MS-based analysis of minute protein
                 amounts, down to the level of single cells. Application of
                 this technology revealed that single-cell transcriptomes are
                 dominated by stochastic noise due to the very low number of
                 transcripts per cell, whereas the single-cell proteome appears
                 to be complete. The spatial organization of cells in tissues
                 can be studied by emerging technologies, including multiplexed
                 imaging and spatial transcriptomics, which can now be combined
                 with ultra-sensitive proteomics. Combined with high-content
                 imaging, artificial intelligence and single-cell laser
                 microdissection, MS-based proteomics provides an unbiased
                 molecular readout close to the functional level. Potential
                 applications range from basic biological questions to
                 precision medicine.",
