                 injury independent of the initial insult, destroying tissue
                 architecture and driving organ failure. Here we discover a
                 population of profibrotic macrophages marked by expression of
                 Spp1, Fn1, and Arg1 (termed Spp1 macrophages), which expands
                 after organ injury. Using an unbiased approach, we identify
                 the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 4 (CXCL4) to be among the
                 top upregulated genes during profibrotic Spp1 macrophage
                 differentiation. In vitro and in vivo studies show that loss
                 of Cxcl4 abrogates profibrotic Spp1 macrophage differentiation
                 and ameliorates fibrosis after both heart and kidney injury.
                 Moreover, we find that platelets, the most abundant source of
                 CXCL4 in vivo, drive profibrotic Spp1 macrophage
                 differentiation. Single nuclear RNA sequencing with
                 ligand-receptor interaction analysis reveals that macrophages
                 orchestrate fibroblast activation via Spp1, Fn1, and Sema3

              sequencing data, frequently used for the analysis of divergent

              technology is still in its infancy for the analysis of cell types
              using proteomic data due to challenges with
              repeatability/reproducibility, variable reference standards and
              the lack of single-cell proteomic reference data. Here, we
              developed a novel deep learning-based deconvolution method
              (scpDeconv) tailored to proteomic data. scpDeconv uses an
              autoencoder to leverage the information from bulk proteomic data
              to improve the quality of single-cell proteomic data, and employs
              a domain adversarial architecture to bridge the single-cell and
              bulk data distributions and transfer labels from single-cell data
              to bulk data. Extensive experiments validated the performance of
              scpDeconv in the deconvolution of proteomic data produced from
              various species/sources and different proteomic technologies.

                 understand the statistical power available to test specific
                 hypotheses when designing and interpreting such experiments.
                 Ideally, it would be possible to create an oracle that
                 predicts sampling requirements for generalized spatial
                 experiments. However, the unknown number of relevant spatial
                 features and the complexity of spatial data analysis make this
